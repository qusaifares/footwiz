# FootWiz

## Introduction

As someone who loves following professional football (soccer) but is always on a tight schedule, I wanted to create a place for football fans to be able to keep up without having to spend 90 minutes watching each match. FootWiz is a website containing information on the top 5 leagues including all their teams and players.

## User Stories

- **As a FootWiz user**, I want to introduce myself to professional soccer.

- **As a FootWiz user**, I want to see all soccer players grouped by their respective teams to make it easy to navigate to a specific player.

- **As a FootWiz user**, I want to be able to track the standings in the league I'm following.

- **As a FootWiz user**, I want to find information on a specific player, team or league quickly and easily.

- **As a FootWiz user**, I want to get live soccer scores when I can't watch the game.

## Planning

I created [this interactive prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5a23a9b8-eaa4-4c1d-6c93-454e15058916-2c12/?fullscreen) using Adobe XD which helped me visualize my final product and in turn allowed the development of this application to go smoothly.

## Data

I'm using two APIs to provide the data in this project.

- **[TheSportsDB API](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php)** provides all football-related information.
